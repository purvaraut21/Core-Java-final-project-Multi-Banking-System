# Core-Java-final-project-Multi-Banking-System
A Multi-Banking System is a application that allows users to access and manage multiple bank accounts from different financial institutions in one centralized interface. This system enables users to view balances, transfer funds, and perform other banking tasks across different banks without the need to log into each bank's individual platform.
